						Why did you move to Jammu?<br>
						After completion of M.Sc., I was searching for a job as Assistant Professor in Computer Science. I found it at MIET, so I moved to Jammu.
					</li><br>
					<li>
						Are there terrorists in Jammu?<br>
						No.
					</li><br>
					<li>
						Why you went for M.Sc. in CS after doind B.Tech. in CSE, the usual path should be to go for M.Tech.?<br>
						M.Sc. CS in Central University of Bihar offered the subjects I wanted to get deeper understanding of, like Automata Theory, Data Structures, Algorithms and Compilers, while M.Tech. offered a plethora of subjects which I did not want to study at the time.<br>
					</li><br>
					<li>
						Why don't you go join industry?<br>
						Academia is the breeding ground for industry. Major research contributions and projects from academia are developed into life-changing products by the industry. I am more into research, invention and prototyping in diverse domains, applying computer science to solve real-world problems, which makes academia, particularly MIET, the best place for me to be.<br>
						Another narrative is that education is actually an industry, or, there is no future of academia if its not industrious.
					</li><br>
					<li>
						Will you guide my project?<br>
						Presently, I am not guiding any projects other than those assigned by the Project Review Committee and CRIE. If you have a good idea on which you want to work under my guidance, please email me the synopsis and we can discuss the possiblities.
					</li><br>
					<li>
						I have sent you many mails and messages, why don't you reply?<br>
						I usually reply all new conversations with new people on Friday evening, if I can eke out the time. In case, I couldn't get the time, I would reply them next Friday. If its urgent, just send me a reminder in the same mail loop.
					</li><br>
					<li>
