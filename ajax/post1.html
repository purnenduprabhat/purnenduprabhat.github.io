				<b>How to balance family and social responsibility with your research work?</b><br>
				Research needs a much deeper engagement with the domain you are working on. It is natural to be totally lost, and enjoy that state of flow, and just forget about everything else.This causes you to loose on your family and social responsibilities. And sometimes, this causes discomfort around you which eventually disturbs you.<br>
				Here is a list of thins you can try out:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Research is your profession. Make this very clear to the people in your life.<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Understand that it is your responsibilty to fulfil the needs of people who depend on you. Keep in mind that you don't have to fulfil their lavish desires emerging for the purpose of mere ego satisfaction. Be firm in this.<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						You will need to work from home as well. The place where you work in home, keep it out of regular interruptions. And don't allow anyone to be there unnecessarily. Work there for a few hours daily. Atleast jsut sit there. Name this place as your office.
					</li>
					<li>
						Be realistic. Be clear about your finances and how much help people can expect from you. You might be invited to an event which costs much time and money, and you cannot afford, so, just plainly decline citing the exact reason. There is no need to be shy about not having enough time to give to society or not having enough financial backup. Your most important contribution to the society is your research work. It adds knowledge and thus advances humanity.
					</li>
				</ul>
